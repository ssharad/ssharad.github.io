A revamp of my website was a long pending agenda in my #TODO. I was getting really comfortable writing in markdown, especially the Github flavor of markdown. With a new habit change to cultivate a habit of writing, I wanted a blog which integrates within my normal workflow. I tried using Medium and Wordpress which are good platforms to write but I preferred something where I have more choices in customization and maintenance => switched to Jekyll.

Once the website is up and running, I shall update this page with the entire process of development.
