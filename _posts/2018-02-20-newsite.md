A revamp of my website was a long pending agenda in my #TODO. I was getting really comfortable writing in markdown, especially the Github flavor of markdown. With a new habit change to cultivate a habit of writing, I wanted a blog which integrates within my normal workflow. I tried using Medium and Wordpress which are good platforms to write but I preferred something where I have more choices in customization and maintenance => switched to Jekyll.

The website is developed based on a quick walkthrough based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M). The video is developed by `dataoptimal` which fast tracks your development of a jekyll based website. I wanted a clean and simple layout for my website which was also checked in the video where the [`minimal mistakes`](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) jekyll theme is used.

There are plenty of options available for you to theme your Jekyll powered website at [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io/free). 

In terms of development, the accompanying [Github repository](https://github.com/dataoptimal/github-pages-tutorial) is very useful. If you are adding specific folders like `projects`, `publications`, etc. you will need to edit the `_config.yml` file by adding the following lines after the `#HTML Compression` block of code.

```yaml
collections:
  projects:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path/
  publications:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path/
```

Once, you specify the collection, jekyll understands that these sub-directories contain content for the website. To make sure the contents appear on the website we will need to specify the default layout which can be done adding the following lines under `defaults` in the `_config.yml` file as,

```yaml
  # _projects
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: projects
    values:
      layout: single
      author_profile: true
      read_time: false
      comments: false
      share: false
      related: false

  # _publications
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: publications
    values:
      layout: single
      author_profile: true
      read_time: false
      comments: false
      share: false
      related: false
```
These defaults can be overwritten with custom layouts when you create content for the website.

#### Adding an image in the content:
If you are one of the early visitors of the website, the content do not have examples with images. In case you want to add images to the posts, use the following syntax:

```html
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/filename.ext" alt="text">
```
#### Take-away messages:
1. YAML uses `spaces`, so use the space bar instead of the tab space for indentation
2. Check out the [official jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com) before starting development
3. Watch or read a tutorial on *How to build a website using Jekyll?* This will help you develop fast!
  - There is a designer portfolio example on [DevTips' Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJhhLvW-Xvg&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KeBN2krBtcO3U90_7SOl-A), which is more design intensive.
4. Knowing how git works saves time
