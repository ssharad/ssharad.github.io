I have been playing with different frameworks and static site generators to build my website. The past builds of the website ranged from a static, one-page website developed using different HTML/CSS theme to the previous build which was developed on Hugo. Before upgrading my website using Jekyll, with a custom theme.

#### The upgrade
After many failed attempts to tweak the base theme of the previous build, I found myself coming back to use Jekyll. I have been using Jekyll for different projects and even had some test builds for my website using the [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. 

I have always like the website themes that were created by [ajlkn](https://html5up.net/) on [https://html5up.net/](https://html5up.net/). Instead of using a theme directly in its native HTML/CSS falvor, I wanted to find themes in Jekyll that were ports of  [https://html5up.net/](https://html5up.net/) themes. I stumbled upon this theme, called [ReadOnly](https://html5up.net/read-only) which was ported by [digitaladapt](https://github.com/digitaladapt/). This port became the base for my new website build. This time, I spent some time getting familiar with the `Liquid` templating language that Jekyll uses to tweak this theme for this current build.

That's all on the website upgrade. I think I will be sticking to this build for a while.. (*fingers crossed!*).

#### Blog plans
The plan for this blog is to make it a sort of development/ research journal where I note down things I learn or come across.
While the current plan of the blog is mostly intended for journalling purposes, I hope it can help some one later who might be working on a similar topic. 

The blog's name *Random rambles* as it sounds will also be about things I find interesting, like productivity hacks and living with less along with an occassional cooking experiment. So, if the built up to this blog was made as a technical one.. the answer is that it will be me rambling about random things I stumble upon.

Till next time.
