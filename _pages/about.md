I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), in the Netherlands specializing in Data Science and Technology. My research interest lies in the intersection of human-in-the-loop data science, machine learning and human computation. My goal is to design and develop effective systems for humans where the machine and humans collaborate to get the job done!
