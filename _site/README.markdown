## About

I maintain my website's source code in this repo. 

The current build of my website, uses Jekyll as the static site generator.

#### Credits
The theme for the website is based on the [ReadOnly](https://html5up.net/read-only) by [ajlkn](https://html5up.net/).
The jekyll-port of the [ReadOnly theme](https://github.com/digitaladapt/html5up-readonly) by [digitaladapt](https://github.com/digitaladapt/) served as both an inspiration and base for this current build.
