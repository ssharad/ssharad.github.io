              <h4><a href="/blog/2020/12/19/update.html">The infinite loop - website upgrade</a></h4>
              <div>Dec 19, 2020</div><p>I have been playing with different frameworks and static site generators to build my dream website.
The past builds of the website ranged from a static, one-page website developed using different HTML/CSS theme to the previous build which was developed on Hugo.</p>

<h2 id="the-upgrade">The upgrade</h2>
<p>After many failed attempts to tweak the base theme of the previous build, I found myself coming back to use Jekyll. I have been using Jekyll for different projects and even had some test builds for my website using the <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">minimal-mistakes</a> theme.</p>

<p>I have always like the website themes that were created by <a href="https://html5up.net/">ajlkn</a> on <a href="https://html5up.net/">https://html5up.net/</a>. Instead of using a theme directly in its native HTML/CSS falvor, I wanted to find themes in Jekyll that were ports of  <a href="https://html5up.net/">https://html5up.net/</a> themes. I stumbled upon this theme, called <a href="https://html5up.net/read-only">ReadOnly</a> which was ported by <a href="https://github.com/digitaladapt/">digitaladapt</a>. This port became the base for my new website build. This time, I spent some time getting familiar with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Liquid</code> templating language that Jekyll uses to tweak this theme for this current build.</p>

<p>That’s all on the website upgrade. I think I will be sticking to this build for a while.. (<em>fingers crossed!</em>).</p>

<h2 id="blog-plans">Blog plans</h2>
<p>The plan for this blog is to make it a sort of development/ research journal where I note down things I learn or come across.
While the current plan of the blog is mostly intended for journalling purposes, I hope it can help some one later who might be working on a similar topic.</p>

<p>The blog’s name <em>Random rambles</em> as it sounds will also be about things I find interesting, like productivity hacks and living with less along with an occassional cooking experiment. So, if the built up to this blog was made as a technical one.. the answer is that it will be me rambling about random things I stumble upon.</p>

<p>Till next time.</p>
