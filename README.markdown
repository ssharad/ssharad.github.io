## About

I maintain my website's source code in this repo. The current build of my website, uses Jekyll as the static site generator.

#### Working with this website
- Clone this repository
- Ensure Jekyll is installed on your computer, more information on setting up Jekyll is found in the [official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
- `cd` to the cloned repository and type the following command to get Jekyll to serve the website through a local server: 
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

It is recommended to go through the [Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and [Step by Step Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) of Jekyll to get started adapting or customizing the source code for your build.
