If you are stopping by this page, it&rsquo;s really nice of you to drop by, Thank you!
It has been a while, like a few years, since I wanted to write and maintain a blog. I had spent close these few years thinking, scribbling and rethinking of what I would want to write about, while my vocabulary witnessed a gradual degradation in the context of an operating system.
In those four years, I had been building some awesome things, mostly as part of my courserwork but now that I think about them, I lost most of my notes working on them.">

        <p>Hi!!</p>
<p>If you are stopping by this page, it&rsquo;s really nice of you to drop by, Thank you!</p>
<p>It has been a while, like a few years, since I wanted to write and maintain a blog. I had spent close these few years thinking, scribbling and rethinking of what I would want to write about, while my vocabulary witnessed a <em><a href="https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/graceful-degradation">gradual degradation</a></em> in the context of an operating system.</p>
<p>In those four years, I had been building some awesome things, mostly as part of my courserwork but now that I think about them, I lost most of my notes working on them.
Thus, this blog will become a sort of development journal where I shall write about my experiences and approach to setup the development environment and start working on my current projects.</p>
<p>I shall also revisit some of the older ones and post them as self-contained posts which you could try on your own computer.</p>
<p>The time frame between the first few posts should be fairly small and I shall try to update this blog periodically.</p>
<p>Till next time!</p>
