### ssharad.github.io
This is the code repository for the academic/professional website of Sharad Shriram. This is a simple website design with ease-of-update and maintainance as the design principle. This is more suitable for a researcher, software developer or anyone who is in need of a simple, minimal website template but not for designers in my opinion.

All the content of this website are owned by (Sharad Shriram)[https://github.com/sharadshriram]

### TODO:
1. redesign the website with minimal styling and with simple, short textual description
2. remove or delete unused and unwanted blocks of code and libraries
3. replace existing bootstrap classes for tags with a custom css file, similar for the js.
4. improve the color scheme for the overall website
5. minimise webpages - combine multiple pages
6. projects will be showcased as a list with a thumbnail
7. improve the formatting, layouts and fonts used in the website
8. improve code quality
