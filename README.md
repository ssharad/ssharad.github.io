#### TODO and Goals
1. Add projects as CSS gallery for projects
2. Decide projects to add to the website

After completing the website, do the following to improve loading time

1. Compress CSS files – Minify and compress the CSS code, again to reduce CSS file size so that it loads as fast as possible. While many plugins can do this, but it increases server load. Remove unnecessary white-space and CSS comments. We do online CSS Compression using YUI Compressor manually. [http://refresh-sf.com/yui/](http://refresh-sf.com/yui/)

2. Remove unused CSS code – We use GTmetrix to identify unused CSS and remove CSS bloat easily. Why load unused CSS when it is not required.[http://gtmetrix.com/remove-unused-css.html](http://gtmetrix.com/remove-unused-css.html)

3. Keep the code well commented and easy to read. :)
