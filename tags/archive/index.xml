      <description>Hi!!
If you are stopping by this page, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice of you to drop by, Thank you!
It has been a while, like a few years, since I wanted to write and maintain a blog. I had spent close these few years thinking, scribbling and rethinking of what I would want to write about, while my vocabulary witnessed a gradual degradation in the context of an operating system.
In those four years, I had been building some awesome things, mostly as part of my courserwork but now that I think about them, I lost most of my notes working on them.</description>
